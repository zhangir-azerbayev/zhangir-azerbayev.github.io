title: Reflections on Timothy Gowers' Manifesto
---

This morning, eminent mathematician Timothy Gowers announced he was building an automated theorem proving team and
released a [54 page manifesto](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-FFa6nMVg18m1zPtoAQrFalwpx2YaGK4/view). I was thrilled 
by this announcement: Gowers is one of my mathematical heros. His contributions include the insight that combinatorial
methods can be used to study functional analysis, which revolutionzed our understanding of the geometry of Banach spaces, 
for example by resolving the Banach-hyperplane conjecture. He also applied analytic methods to combinatorial problems, 
most famously in his alternate proof of Szemeredi's theorem. Aside from my personal love of Gowers' work, I am always
happy to see mainstream pen-and-paper mathematicians embrace computer-assisted theorem proving, since it is primarily 
mainstream mathematicians who convince other mainstream mathematicians to learn about computer theorem proving. 

Let me briefly summarize Gowers' program. He begins with the observation that the general problem of furnishing a proof
given a well-formed mathematical proposition is undecidable. So how is that humans prove theorems? The key is that 
humans are not interested in proving arbitrary theorems plucked from &#120121;, the entire space statement-proof pairs. 
Instead mathematicians are interested in a subspace of &#120121;, which we'll call &#120132;, that comprises
all intersting mathematical statements paired with a satisfying proof, where a statement may be interesting because it has a property like 
"is beautiful", "is a natural question about elementary objects", or "is party of a research program". A proof is satisfying
to the extent that it provides genuine understanding, rather than just being a formal deriviation. Gowers is 
interested in accomplishing three goals: 

1. Figure out what distinguishes &#120121; from &#120132;. 
2. Figure out why it is feasible for humans to find a proof P of statement S when (S,P) belongs to &#120132;. 
3. Use the insights from answering (1) and (2) to build a GOFAI human-level automated theorem prover (ATP) that produces human-friendly proofs.
