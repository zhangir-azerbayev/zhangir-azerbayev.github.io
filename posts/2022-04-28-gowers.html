<h1 id="reflections-on-timothy-gowers-manifesto">Reflections on Timothy Gowers&#39; Manifesto</h1>
<p><em>2022-04-28</em></p>
<p>This morning, the distinguished mathematician Timothy Gowers announced he was building an automated theorem proving team and
released a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-FFa6nMVg18m1zPtoAQrFalwpx2YaGK4/view">54 page manifesto</a>. I was thrilled 
by this news: Gowers is one of my mathematical heroes. His contributions include the insight that combinatorial
methods can be used to study functional analysis, which greatly advanced our understanding of the geometry of Banach spaces by resolving the Banach-hyperplane problem among many other results. He also applied analytic methods to combinatorial problems, 
most famously in his alternate proof of Szemeredi&#39;s theorem. Aside from my personal love of Gowers&#39; work, I am always
happy to see mainstream pen-and-paper mathematicians embrace computer-assisted theorem proving. It is primarily 
mainstream mathematicians who convince other mainstream mathematicians to learn about computer theorem-proving. </p>
<p>Let me briefly summarize Gowers&#39; program. He begins with the observation that the general problem of supplying a proof
given a well-formed mathematical proposition is undecidable. So how is it that humans prove theorems? The key is that 
humans are not interested in proving arbitrary theorems plucked from &#120121;, the entire space of statement-proof pairs. 
Instead mathematicians are interested in a subspace of &#120121;, which we&#39;ll call &#120132;, whose elements are interesting mathematical statements paired with a satisfying proof. A statement may be interesting because it has a property like 
&quot;is beautiful&quot;, &quot;is a natural question about elementary objects&quot;, or &quot;is party of a research program&quot; and a proof is satisfying
to the extent that it provides genuine understanding, rather than just being a formal deriviation. Gowers is 
interested in accomplishing three goals: </p>
<ol>
<li>Figure out what distinguishes &#120132; from &#120121;.  </li>
<li>Figure out why it is feasible for humans to find a proof P of statement S when (S,P) belongs to &#120132;. </li>
<li>Use the insights gained from answering (1) and (2) to build a GOFAI human-level automated theorem prover (ATP) that produces satisfying proofs. </li>
</ol>
<p>My expectation is that efforts into (1) and (2) will be tremendousfly fruitful---these are the most profound questions
about the relationship between mathematics and mathematicians, and as far as I know they are barely studied. However, 
I doubt that the answers to (1) and (2) will translate into progress on (3), and furthermore, I believe any attempt to build 
a GOFAI human-level ATP has an exceedingly low probability of success. </p>
<p>The long history of AI research has shown that building systems by enumerating the rules they are supposed to follow does
not scale to near human-level performance on intelligent tasks. After testing such a system, the researcher realizes
there is an edge case they forgot to account for, and go back to to add a rule for this edge 
case. But iterating this process of trial-and-error does not converge: the problem is like a Hydra, where for every 
new rule you add you also discover a panoply of new edge cases the new rules don&#39;t cover. This pattern has unfolded in 
vision, board games, language, speech processing, information retrieval, and just about every other field of AI. </p>
<p>Instead of trying to figure out the algorithm for an intelligent task, what has instead succeeded is writing a 
<em>meta-algorithm</em> that searches program-space in order to learn an algorithm for the intelligent task, i.e machine learning. Why does 
GOFAI typically fail and learning often succeed? I suspect because of something like the following: call an algorithm
<em>illegible</em> if it is so unintelligble and fiendishly complicated that it would be next to impossible for a human, with
their limited mental powers, to discover and implement. The only hope for solving tasks that require illegible algorithms
is machine learning. </p>
<p>The history of AI suggests that vision, speech and language processing, and board-game playing demand illegible
algorithms. We can reformulate our question of whether a GOFAI program inspired by studying human mathematical reasoning
can be a human-level ATP as follows: is the human theorem-proving algorithm (henceforth HTPA) unintelligble? I think there are strong grounds to believe it is. First, it certainly seems that playing Go at a human level requires
an illegible algorithm, and I&#39;d expect that the game tree of Go is a far less complex object than the collection
of proof-search trees of statement in &#120132;.</p>
<p>Note that I do not rule out the possibility that the collection of proof-search trees corresponding to proofs in &#120132; is actually a far simpler
object than the Go game-tree. Perhaps Gowers may discover that the structure
of mathematical proof-space is much simpler than we thought, in fact so simple we don&#39;t need learning to navigate
it with human-level performance. But I think the probability of this being the case is low. </p>
<p>Moreover, if the HTPA were legible, I suspect we would&#39;ve already discovered much about it during the countless 
hours we spend teaching mathematics. After all, directly teaching the HTPA would be the optimal way of 
teaching mathematics. Consider books such as Polya&#39;s <em>How To Solve It</em> or Velleman&#39;s <em>How to Prove It</em>. In the world
of a legible HTPA, these books could have initiated a research program that made steady progress in describing
how the best mathematicians discover proofs in ever greater detail. But it seems we live in a world where we can&#39;t
say much more about how to do mathematics than is in <em>How To Prove It</em>, and the only way to learn to prove theorems
is to solve a lot of exercises.  </p>
<p>I see the relation between Gowers&#39; program and automated theorem proving as similar to the relationship between 
linguistics and NLP. Linguistics comprises our fundamental knowledge of what language <em>is</em> in terms of things like
universal grammar, syntax trees, and theories of semantics, in much the same way &#120132; encapsulates what mathematics
<em>is</em>. However, all attempts to leverage linguistic knowledge for building language processing machines have failed. 
Instead, to build NLP systems we use learning algorithms that search program-space to find a functional 
equivalent of the human language processing algorithm. Similarly, I expect we will be unable to leverage
our understanding of &#120132; to build a human-level ATP. At the same time, living in a world where we have GPT-3 but no 
theory of semantics would be unsatisfying, in the same way that having a human-level ATP but no understanding of the structure of &#120132; would be unsatisfying. </p>
